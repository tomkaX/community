          intro: >
                   Chartist does not freak out if you have holes in your data. Instead it will render the lines in
                   segments and handles these holes gracefully. This also allows you to introduce a line at a later
                   point or to terminate the series before others.

                   Sometimes you don't want your data looking so fragmented, even when it really is.  That's why you
                   can also configure Chartist to smooth over holes in your data.

          intro: >
                   You're dealing with series that contain only whole numbers? It looks weird that Chartist is creating
                   a scale that contains fractions even if your data does not? No problem! Tell the Chartist guy to
                   only use integers and he'll do the math!

          intro: >
                   This advanced example uses a line chart to draw a scatter diagram. The data object is created
                   with a functional style random mechanism. There is a mobile first responsive configuration using
                   the responsive options to show less labels on small screens.

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                   This chart uses the showArea option to draw line, dots but also an area shape. Use the low option to
                   specify a fixed lower bound that will make the area expand. You can also use the areaBase property
                   to specify a data value that will be used to determine the area shape base position (this is 0 by default).

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                   Chartist has fixed graphical representations that are chosen because of their flexibility and to
                   provide a high level of separation of the concerns. However, sometimes you probably would like to use
                   different shapes or even images for your charts. One way to achieve this is by using the draw events and replace
                   or add custom SVG shapes.

          intro: >
                   Chartist provides a simple API to animate the elements on the Chart using SMIL. Usually you can achieve most
                   animation with CSS3 animations but in some cases you'd like to animate SVG properties that are not available
                   in CSS.

          classes: ct-golden-section
          intro: >
                    You can also set your bar chart to stack the series bars on top of each other easily by using the
                    <code>stackBars</code> property in your configuration.

          intro: >
                    Guess what! Creating horizontal bar charts is as simple as it can get. There's no new chart type
                    you need to learn, just passing an additional option is enough.

                    Although it'd be also possible to achieve this animation with CSS, with some minor suboptimal
                    things, here's an example of how to animate donut charts using Chartist.Svg.animate and SMIL.
